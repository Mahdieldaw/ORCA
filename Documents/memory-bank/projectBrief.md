Okay, here is a Project Brief / Product Brief document tailored for the Hybrid Thinking MVP, reflecting the state after completing the planned Phases 1-3 (UI Shell, Backend Scaffolding, Data Binding & Integration) and looking towards Phase 4 (Polish).

Project Brief: Hybrid Thinking - MVP v1.0
1. Introduction & Vision

Hybrid Thinking is a web platform designed to empower users, particularly those without deep technical AI expertise, to create, execute, manage, and reuse multi-stage AI workflows.

MVP Vision: To deliver a functional core platform where users can define sequences of AI tasks (stages), run them using selected language models, perform basic validation, and save/review their work, establishing a foundation for a more sophisticated "workflow memory" system.

Core Problem Solved (MVP): Provides structure and orchestration for multi-step AI interactions, moving beyond single prompts and enabling users to build repeatable AI processes with basic quality control and persistence.

2. MVP Goal

Upon completion of the MVP (Phases 1-4), users will be able to:

Authenticate: Securely sign up and log in to the platform.

Create & Manage Workflows: Define named workflows consisting of multiple, ordered stages.

Configure Stages: For each stage, define a prompt template (using {{variable}} syntax), select an available Large Language Model (LLM), and configure basic validation rules (Manual or Regex).

Execute Workflows: Initiate a workflow run, provide necessary initial inputs, and observe stage-by-stage execution.

Interact with Execution: View AI outputs for each stage and perform manual validation (Pass/Fail) when required.

Handle Errors: Retry failed stages (up to a defined limit).

Review History: View logs of past executions for a workflow via a contextual overlay (Ghost Overlay).

Persist & Reuse (Snapshots): Save the entire structure of a workflow as a named snapshot and restore a new workflow instance from a saved snapshot.

3. Target Audience (MVP)

Individuals or small teams exploring structured AI usage (e.g., content creators, analysts, researchers, process improvers).

Users comfortable with web applications but not necessarily AI coding/APIs.

Early adopters willing to provide feedback on a foundational workflow tool.

4. Core Technology Stack (MVP)

Frontend: Next.js (React), Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui

State Management: TanStack Query, Zustand

Backend: NestJS (Node.js, TypeScript)

AI Core: LangChain.js (or Python) integrated into the backend

Database: PostgreSQL (managed via Prisma)

Authentication: Clerk (or Supabase Auth)

5. Phased Development Overview (MVP Build)

Phase 1: UI & Frontend Prototyping (Completed):

Built the complete visual shell of the application (Workflow Explorer, Stage Controller, Drawers, Overlays) using static mock data.

Established core UI components, layout, navigation, and responsiveness. Validated the user flow visually.

Phase 2: Backend Engineering & Data Structure (Completed):

Implemented the backend API structure using NestJS.

Defined the PostgreSQL database schema using Prisma and ran initial migrations.

Scaffolded core backend services (Workflows, Stages, Executions, Snapshots, AI Service, Validation Service) and basic logic, including authentication middleware.

Phase 3: Data Binding & Integration ( refer to Documents\phase 3.3 cont.md until completed ):

Connected the Phase 1 frontend components to the Phase 2 backend API endpoints using TanStack Query hooks and Axios.

Replaced mock data with live data fetching for workflows, stages, executions, logs, and snapshots.

Wired up core user interactions (creating/saving workflows/stages, starting executions, manual validation, retries, saving/restoring snapshots) to trigger backend mutations.

Implemented global state management (Zustand) for active workflow/stage/execution context.

Established basic polling for execution status updates.

Cleaned up code, finalized types, and removed mock data dependencies.

Phase 4: Final Polish & Production Readiness (Current / Next Phase):

Focus on refining the user experience based on the integrated system. This includes improving loading states, error handling messages, UI transitions, empty states, and addressing minor layout inconsistencies. Implement the dynamic progress indicator and finalize the display of real output/validation data. Conduct thorough end-to-end testing, fix bugs, and prepare the environment (hosting, CI/CD basics) for an initial user-facing launch or beta release. Add basic user onboarding elements (tooltips, simple guides).

6. Key MVP Features (Post Phase 3 -> Aim of Phase 4 Polish)

Workflow Editor: Create/Name/Describe Workflows; Add/Delete/Reorder Stages; Configure Stage (Prompt, Model Select, Validation Type [Manual/Regex], Retry Limit).

Execution Runner: Start execution with initial inputs; View current stage prompt/output; Manual Pass/Fail buttons; Retry button (conditional); Progress indicator.

Persistence: Workflows & Stages saved to DB; Execution history logged (execution_logs).

Snapshots: Save current workflow definition; List saved snapshots; Restore workflow from snapshot.

Ghost Overlay: Contextual panel showing recent execution logs and available snapshots for the current workflow. Basic "Inject" placeholder.

Authentication: User signup/login. Data isolated per user (RLS implemented via backend logic/Prisma).

7. Non-Goals for MVP (Post-MVP / Future Phases)

Advanced LLM-based validation.

Visual branching editor / complex conditional logic execution.

Dedicated Prompt Library / Template Marketplace.

Team collaboration features (sharing, roles, comments).

Granular saving (saving individual stages/prompts outside snapshots).

Advanced analytics dashboard.

Real-time collaborative editing or execution viewing (beyond basic status polling).

External tool integrations (beyond core LLMs).

Sophisticated AI Tool Recommendations.

8. Success Metrics (MVP Launch)

Number of registered users.

Number of workflows created.

Average number of stages per workflow.

Workflow execution completion rate (vs. failure/abandonment).

Snapshot save/restore feature usage.

Qualitative feedback from initial beta users on usability and core value.

This brief outlines the state and goals after completing the core integration (Phase 3) and sets the stage for the final polishing phase (Phase 4) to achieve a launch-ready MVP.
